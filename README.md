# Crappy Groceryy Appliction

This is a tutorial application for I don't know what but for me to learn iced-rs :)

Took the inspiration (COPIED) from here ===> https://www.leafheap.com/articles/iced-tutorial-version-0-12

Anyways if you want to run this shit and by change you are on `nix` then

`nix develop `
`cargo run`

if you are on any other distro `cargo run` after figuring out how to setup `dlopen` if you get this error : 
```
error: WaylandError(Connection(NoWaylandLib)) })
note: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace
```
